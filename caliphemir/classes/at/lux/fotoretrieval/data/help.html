<h1>How to use this program?</h1>
<p>There are four possible ways to use this program:<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Search for textual content in an existing MPEG-7 image description</li>
  <li>Search through the image Description by giving an XPath statement</li>
  <li>Search through query-by-image using two possible types of retrieval
methods</li>
  <li>Search for a matchiung sub-graph of the semantic description</li>
</ol>
<h2>Option 1: Textual search</h2>
<p>You can either give an Agent (which defines a person) or one or more keywords.
Its not possible to use both at the same time. </p>
<p>Before you start the search by hitting the "Search" button make sure you've
  defined the directory where the search starts, default is yout current working
  directory. You can also set the quality to a desired value to get all pictures
  that have either excatly the given quality or more are less than given.</p>
<h2>Option 2: XPath</h2>
<p>Mainly a developer option is the search by creating an XPath statement a complex
  task. Define your statement and yout base directory and Emir will look out for
  matching documents.</p>
<h2>Option 3: Content based image retrieval</h2>
<p>Define an example image using the &quot;Browse&quot; button in the upper right
  corner of the window. Very much alike the other options you can define a base
  directory, where the search starts.</p>
<p>You can use two different ways of comparing the images: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Color Layout</li>
  <li>Scalable Color</li>
</ol>
<p>Both ways have their different positive and negative effects, you'll have to
  try which one fits best.</p>
<h2>Option 4: Searching a sub-graph</h2>
<p>You can specify your subgraph with the text input fields given on this panel, a preview
of the resulting graph is given below. Although you can only specify a very limited number
of possible graphs this search option is still very powerful.</p>
<h1>Browsing the results</h1>
<p>After hitting the &quot;Search&quot; button the Search will take a while, a
  progress bar will tell you about the ongoing work. After examinig all MPEG-7
  documents Emir will visualize the documents in a List, sorted by relevance.
  If no thumbnail image is defined in the description no preview will appear.
  Although, if you click with your mouse onto the place where the thumbnail should
  show up, it will be loaded.</p>
<p>If you have browsed all the results, you can close the tab by hitting &lt;Alt-X&gt;
  or clicking &quot;View -&gt; Close active tab&quot; in the menu.</p>
